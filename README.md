# 💱 @ CAUTION
This is solely for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES** only. I did not intend to make this to harm anything or anyone. 



# 📐 @ Setup

1. To setup this bot, go to ----> **[ https://discord.com.developers/applications ]**
2. Next you want to make a new application 
3. Once you make a new application you want to go to the OAuth2 tab and go to OAuth2 URL Generator 
4. You want to check "bot" and then check "Administrator" and copy the link. 
5. Next you want to paste the link into your browser and invite it to the server you want to nuke
6. Next you want to go back to the Developer Portal and go to the bot tab
7. Next, you want to click "Reset Token" under the Username tab. 
8. Fill in your credentials and copy the Token. 
9. Paste the token into the config in main.py
10. **THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP**!!! Next you want to go back to the bot tab and scroll down and go to intents 
11. Lastly turn on ALL intents and save it

# ✨ @ Config

1. Inside the config in main.py, you want to make sure you fill in everything. 
2. In the token tab you want to paste the bots token
3. Next for the prefix tab, you want to paste a prefix you would like to use for the bot. For example, "!" or "." are common prefixes used among bots. 
4. Next for the nuke_message tab, you want to enter the message that you want the bot to spam when nuking the server. 
5. Next for the channel_name tab you want to enter the name of the channels when the bot is spam making channels ( **WARNING DO NOT MAKE THE CHANNEL NAME TOO LONG, KEEP IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE** )
6. Next for the dm_message tab, you want to put the message the bot will dm everyone
7. For the server_name you want to put the new server name you want
8. For spam_message, you want to put a message that the bot will spam


# 🔧 @ Running
1. Before you run the bot, you want to go to the file and run the installer.bat file! 
2. The installer.bat file installs all libraries you need to run the script. 
3. If you do not run installer.bat and run runner.bat immediately it won't work! 
4. Once you ran installer.bat, you want to run runner.bat
5. **WARNING** I don't know why but theres a stupid issue where the logs just stop working in the middle and commands stop inputting. To fix that issue all u need to do is go to the logs and press "ENTER", thats it, nothing else and just press "ENTER" to fix this issue (only if you have this issue).
